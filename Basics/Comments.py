# Welcome to the Python Comments 
# Comments help explain the code and make it easy to understand


# Single-line comment.

# Python ignores anything after the # symbol.
print("Hello, World")  # This is called Inline comment

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Multi-line comments
"""
Sometimes you want to write a long explanation.
When you need to break down a feature or make a confusing bit of code easier to understand,
multi-line comments can help

Everything inside these triple quotes is ignored by Python.

""" Comments help programmers understand what the code is doing,
    making it easier to read, debug, and maintain later  """

# Simple addition program while applying comments

# Here we store two numbers
num1 = 140       # First number
num2 = 210       # Second number

# Now we add them 
result = num1 + num2

# let's show the result
print("The sum of the two numbers is:", result)
